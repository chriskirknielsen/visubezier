# VisuBezier

Provides a preview when hovering CSS easing functions in [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).

## Features

Hover over any CSS easing function to get a preview of the animation, comparing it to a `linear` easing (default).

## Extension Settings

This extension has a few settings:

-   `visubezier.defaulteasingfunction`: Override the default comparison easing function with any valid easing function expressed as a keyword or a `cubic-bezier()` function (default: `linear`).
-   `visubezier.defaultduration`: Override the duration of the animation with any valid duration expressed as `0.5s` or `500ms` (default: `1s`).
-   `visubezier.defaultbackground`: Override the background color for the preview area (default: `#2d2d30`).
-   `visubezier.defaultcolor`: Override the foreground color for the preview elements (default: `#d7d7d7`).
-   `visubezier.defaultlanguages`: Override the list of languages for which you want to activate the preview. (default: `["css","sass","scss","less","postcss","stylus","xml","svg"]`).

## Post-Install Sample

Paste this sample into VS Code after installing to see it in action:

```css
button {
	transition-timing-function: ease;
	transition-timing-function: ease-in;
	transition-timing-function: ease-out;
	transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
	transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, -0.2, 0.42, 1.2);
	transition-timing-function: steps(7);
	transition-timing-function: steps(5, jump-none);
	transition-timing-function: steps(8, jump-both);
	transition-timing-function: steps(4, jump-start);
	transition-timing-function: steps(2, jump-end);
	transition-timing-function: step-start;
	transition-timing-function: step-end;
	transition-timing-function: ease, steps(3), cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

## Known Issues

-   `cubic-bezier` containing any values other than pure numbers are currently ignored (e.g. `calc()` or `var()`).
-   Points with negative values can cause the animation to fall out of the preview area.
