# Changelog

All notable changes to VisuBezier will be documented in this file.

### 1.6.1 - 2023-09-02

-   Fixed parsing of `linear()` with negative values, and rendering of `linear()` with a value greater than `1` which was previously clamped to `1`.

### 1.6.0 - 2023-03-19

-   Added support for [`linear()` syntax](https://jakearchibald.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-easing-2/Overview.html#the-linear-easing-function) easing functions. Animation preview is not yet implemented in VS Code, but the SVG graph is correctly depicted (based on my interpretation of the spec, which I hope to be correct).
-   Added a licence file.
-   Updated the underlying VS Code Extension required files to run with more modern code (Node 18, TypeScript 5, VS Code 1.76+, and other things I hardly understand).
-   Updated the extension's package to patch vulnerabilities.

### [1.5.0] - 2022-12-01

### Added
